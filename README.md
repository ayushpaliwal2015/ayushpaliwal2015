ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m @ayushpaliwal2015

I am a data-driven individual with a passion for using data analytics to drive business decisions and uncover insights. With a background in both engineering and business analytics, I have developed a unique set of technical and analytical skills that I use to tackle complex problems and create value. 

Presently I am pursuing MS in Business Analytics at University of Cincinnati. Before joining UC, I worked as a Data Scientist at Jio Platforms Limited (Agriculture-IoT). I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology from IIT Kharagpur in 2019, majoring in Aerospace Engineering.

My expertise in machine learning, data visualization, and software development has been honed through various projects, internships, and hackathons, where I have consistently demonstrated my ability to collaborate with cross-functional teams and deliver results.

I am grateful to have participated in several machine learning hackathons, achieving notable rankings among a competitive pool of participants. These opportunities have allowed me to showcase my skills and learn from others, continually striving to improve and bring my best to each challenge.
